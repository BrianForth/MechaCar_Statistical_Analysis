## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![linear_regression](analysis/linear_regression.png)

Based on the data in MechaCar_mpg.csv, Vehicle length and ground clearance both appear to have a greater impact on vehicle mpg than one could expect based on random chance. As the null hypothesis states that none of the selected variable would provide a non-random amount of variance, it can be rejected, and the slope is determined to be non-zero. While vehice length and ground clearance are both statistically unlikely to be impacting mpg to the extent they are by random chance, the Intercept also has a large P>|
t| value, and the r-squared implies a definite connection, but not a very storng one. Both of these facts imply that there are other factors impacting mpg not captured in the data. While we could make a prediction for mpg based on the captured variables, it is likely only valuable as a 'ballpark' estimate.
